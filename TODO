1. Create test scripts for flying of drone and hovering to collect spectrum in orbit-lab.
2. Figure out USB interface with the drone.
3. Remove video streaming from drone capability to save bandwidth, write binary to stream spectrum from the USB device instead.
4. Write client software to pipe streamed spectrum into the analyzer.
5. Figure out control software, eg change settings on collector/analyzer with one middle client program.
